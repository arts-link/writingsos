As a Philly-based writing tutor since 2015, I provide one-on-one online tutoring services to children, teens and adults. I work with budding writers, adults who have never been confident in their writing skills, students who are overwhelmed by their writing assignments, and English language learners who need help for work or academic purposes.

Before Philadelphia, I lived in San Francisco teaching environmental science and literacy to youth, and in Montana, where I got a degree in environmental science and writing. For the last decade, I have been part of several writer's groups helping others edit their material. And in my youth, I was a Peace Corps Volunteer in West Africa, where I learned the value of community and communication. My passions are noticing wildlife, exploring unfamiliar places, discovering new music, and spending time with family.
